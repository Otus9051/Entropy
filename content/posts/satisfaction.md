Bit of backstory on this thing: It was originally written in April 1, 2023. Timestamp says 2:31AM, so I guess I was remembering her. Found this while cleaning my notes. Enjoy.

its been 3 years
since we last talked nicely
about our lives

it has changed, quite a bit
taken up new paces and its not
quite as simple as it was before

i still miss you, even if i hate you
with every ounce of my being
i cant forgive what you have done
but still, i want you *in my arms*

we have never met, really
we just know we exist

this internet thing is wild right?
just, meet people, talk to them
you dont even know them, really
**you dont even care if you do**

you just talk to them 
for your own satisfaction
thats what i was, right?
your momentary satisfaction?

but yet i stay up all night
thinking about you
and the memories we made 
its not much
but it is the only thing that *"satisfies me"*
